/*
Build JavaScript Objects

You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

  name: "Joni",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["Black", "Jack"]
};
